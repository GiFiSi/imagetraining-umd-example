# Image Training UMD Example

This project is an example demonstrating how to use the UMD build of the ImageTraining package for creating (zpt) target files.

## Project Overview


The example is a simple web application that accepts image file inputs (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) from the user, trains the image, and then provides the trained image as a downloadable `.zpt` file which can be used for image tracking.

## Usage

Open the HTML file in any modern browser and follow these steps:

1. Upload an image file by clicking on the file input field.
2. Once the image's loaded, the library will begin training the target image.
4. Upon completion of processing, a "Download" link becomes visible. Clicking on this link will download the generated .zpt file.
